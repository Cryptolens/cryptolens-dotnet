# Release notes for v4014

## Add support for a license server
We added support for local license server that re-routes requests to Cryptolens. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/Cryptolens/license-server).

Assuming your license server runs on localhost with port 80 (default), you can access it by adding `LicenseServerUrl` as shown below:

```cs
var licenseKey = "GEBNC-WZZJD-VJIHG-GCMVD";
var RSAPubKey = "{enter the RSA Public key here}";

var auth = "{access token with permission to access the activate method}";
var result = Key.Activate(token: auth, parameters: new ActivateModel()
{
    Key = licenseKey,
    ProductId = 3349,
    Sign = true,
    MachineCode = Helpers.GetMachineCode()
    LicenseServerUrl = "http://localhost/"      // <- add this line
});

if (result == null || result.Result == ResultType.Error ||
    !result.LicenseKey.HasValidSignature(RSAPubKey).IsValid())
{
    // an error occurred or the key is invalid or it cannot be activated
    // (eg. the limit of activated devices was achieved)
    Console.WriteLine("The license does not work.");
}
else
{
    // everything went fine if we are here!
    Console.WriteLine("The license is valid!");
}

Console.ReadLine();
```

This works for all models, so you can do the same with eg. Deactivate.
