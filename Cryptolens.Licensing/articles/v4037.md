# Release notes for v4037


In this release, we changed the behaviour of GetMachineCode and GetMachineCodePI so that in cases where it is unable to compute the machine code, null will be returned. Previously, the error would not be detected which lead to a generic signature being returned.

As a good practise, we suggest to call GetMachineCode or GetMachineCodePI before calling Key.Activate, and validate that the returned value is not null. If it is null, you can either try to compute it again at a later point or use a different method (which will vary depending on the platform).

From our experience, if the method to compute the machine code works well in a development environment but returns an error for one customer, then the best approach is to re-try calling the method again. If it would fail in development mode, then a different method needs to be used.
