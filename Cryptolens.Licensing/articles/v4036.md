# Release notes for v4036

The following update focuses on improvements of the GetMachineCode method:

1. We have fixed an issue with machine codes on Mac devices. In previous versions, the library would fallback on the UUID method used on Linux. It affected users running the cross platform version of the library.
2. If you use Helpers.GetMachineCode(v:2), i.e. version parameter set to 2 (for example, to get the same value as in the Python client with the same setting), we have switched from using WMIC to obtain the UUID to the following command `/c powershell.exe -Command "(Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_ComputerSystemProduct).UUID"`.

In addition, we have removed support for .NET 4.0 and .NET 4.5. If you would need binaries for those frameworks, you could either use the previous version or contact us at support@cryptolens.io.
