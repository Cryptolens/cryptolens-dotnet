# Release notes for v4040


Change server to check for time tampering to pool.ntp.org from time.windows.com (see #78 for more information).

The base method used to check for time tampering is SKGL.SKM.TimeCheck(). This method is also used in other helper methods. Please keep in mind that this method can throw exceptions. Thus, we recommend using this method the helper methods that use it, and to encapsulate the call in a try-catch. If an error occurs, you could re-run the call again.

Thanks to @keifgwinn.
