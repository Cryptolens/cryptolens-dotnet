# Release notes for v4044

In this release, three changes are made:

1. DaysLeft will now return the same value that is shown in the dashboard. Previously, if a license expired in 23 hours, it would show that as zero days, and from now on, it will treat any value between 1-23h as 1 day left.
2. Added GetHarddiskID which allows you to identify machines by their physical harddisk ID. This method may require admin permission, however, based on our internal testing and testing that was performed by our clients, it does not require admin permission. This method is a good alternative to the default GetMachineCode method in cases where you anticipate that your clients may use the same image on multiple physical machines.
3. When calling the AddCustomer method, you will now be able to see the "secret", which you can use to retrieve all licenses that belong to that customer using GetCustomerLicenses endpoint.
