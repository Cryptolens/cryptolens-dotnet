# Release notes for v4046

Since WMIC is [deprecated starting starting from Windows 11](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/wmi-command-line-wmic-utility-deprecation-next-steps/ba-p/4039242), we have released a new version of `GetMachineCodePI` that uses a Powershell interface to obtain the UUID instead of wmic.

For new projects, it's recommended to use `Helpers.GetMachineCodePI(v: 2)`.

However, assuming that you were using `Helpers.GetMachineCodePI()` without supplying any version parameter, you can now call it using `Helpers.GetMachineCodePI(v: 10)` to obtain the same machine code as `Helpers.GetMachineCodePI()`. This way, the machine code will stay the same, which is especially useful if you already have customers using the old method in production.

We are not updating the original method, `Helpers.GetMachineCodePI()`, in case there are users that use an out of date version of Windows.
